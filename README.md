## 📝 Project Description

The <b>Role Management with Access Control and Workflows</b> project is designed to establish a secure, organized, and automated way of managing user roles and task flows within a ServiceNow environment.  
It focuses on defining **user responsibilities**, enforcing **data access policies**, and integrating **intelligent workflow automation** for smoother collaboration.

---

## ⚙️ Problem Statement

In a small project management team consisting of a **Project Manager (Alice)** and a **Team Member (Bob)**, there is a pressing need to efficiently manage project tasks and maintain accountability throughout the project lifecycle.  

The **current system** suffers from:
- ❌ Undefined roles and responsibilities  
- ⚠️ Lack of proper access control measures  
- 🔁 Unstructured workflows causing confusion  
- 📉 Poor task progress visibility  

As a result, project efficiency and accountability are compromised.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

✅ Clearly define **user roles** and permissions  
✅ Implement **secure access control mechanisms**  
✅ Design **automated workflows** for smooth task management  
✅ Enable **real-time progress tracking** for project transparency  

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

| Role | Responsibilities | Access Level |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| 👩‍💼 **Project Manager (Alice)** | Creates, assigns, and monitors tasks | Full Access |
| 👨‍💻 **Team Member (Bob)** | Executes assigned tasks and updates status | Limited Access |

The workflow automates:
1. Task creation and assignment  
2. Approval requests  
3. Progress tracking  
4. Completion verification
